Are all cases of empathy deduction (like what's implemented in hanab live) really cases of the following:

There exists a set of cards such that the union of their individual possibilities contains exactly as many copies of cards as the cardinality of the set itself. e.g. there are four 5s which together can each only be one of four different cards. When you have such a situation, then you write elim notes for each of the identities in the union, saying that it is in one of those positions. 

Then what do you do with the elim notes to convert them into inferences on the sets of possibilities on individual cards?
